pbmc <- NormalizeData(pbmc)
While this method of normalization is standard and widely used in scRNA-seq analysis, global-scaling relies on an assumption that each cell originally contains the same number of RNA molecules. We and others have developed alternative workflows for the single cell preprocessing that do not make these assumptions. For users who are interested, please check out our SCTransform() normalization workflow. The method is described in ourpaper, with a separate vignette using Seurat here. The use of SCTransform replaces the need to run NormalizeData, FindVariableFeatures, or ScaleData
